# Project Objective
This project (Write a Data Science Blog Post) is part of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

I used Sydney Airbnb Dataset for this project. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, the dataset describes the listing activities of homestays in Sydney NSW Australia. The original dataset can be found here: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html

Due to size limitation, trucncated part of the records but kept all the fields

This project focuses on answering following questions:
“What are the most common amenities in the listings?”
"What attracts the guests most for renting a property?"
“What are the most influencial features of the dataset to estimate the price of a listing?”
“What is the impact of listings' proximity to Sydney City in terms of price?
